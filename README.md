# Single-cell-analysis-
collection of collection of my hands-on experience working as a research intern in the field of system pharmacology and bioinformatics 

Spatial biology analysis: Using scanpy library to spatially visualize the single-cell information

Autoencoder for gene analysis: Implement autoencoder based on pytorchmodel to reduce the dimensionality of gene dataset. Use UMAP to visualize the result and group different type of cell based on UMAP1 UMAP2 feature.
